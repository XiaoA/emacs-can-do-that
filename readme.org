#+TITLE: EMACS can do that ?

* Intro
  - Le site internet de promotion “[[https://vscodecandothat.com/][VSCodeCanDoThat.com]]” proposes 35 points “incroyable” que VS code peut faire.
  - Je vous propose de lancer “EMACS CAN DO THAT” qui reprendrait ces points.
  - Si ca marche on pourrait en faire un petit site internet pour troller :)
  - C'est le début du projet

| 01 | Balance Inward/Outward                        | You can select a whole tag in VS Code by using the balance inward and balance outward Emmet commands. It's helpful to bind these commands to keyboard shortcuts, like Ctrl + Shift + Up Arrow for Balance Outward and Ctrl + Shift + Down Arrow for Balance Inward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                            |
| 02 | Pull Requests                                 | The Github Pull Requests extension from Github allows you to view and interact with your Pull Requests directly from within VS Code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Use magit : https://magit.vc/                                                                                                              |
| 03 | Toggle Sidebar Focus                          | You can navigate in and out of the sidebar without ever touching the mouse. Use ⌃/⌘+ 0 to set focus to the Siebar and ⌃/⌘+ 1 to set it to the editor. On a Mac, you can use ⌃/⌘+ ⇣ to select a file in the Sidebar Explorer with your keyboard. On Windows just press the enter key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | M - x 3                                                                                                                                    |
| 04 | Breadcrumbs                                   | This tip is brought to you by Brian Holt. Use the Breadcrumbs feature in VS Code to quickly jump between folders, files and even sections in code without ever leaving your current tab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | doomline mode ? https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline                                                                                |
| 05 | Slack Chat                                    | The Slack Chat extension for VS Code embeds a chat window in the editor. This is paticularly useful for chatting during Live Share sessions. It has the added benefit of being able to start a Live Share session with the "/live share" command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | emacs slack client :  https://github.com/yuya373/emacs-slack                                                                               |
| 06 | Soft Undo                                     | Use the Soft Undo (⌘/⌃ + U) to move the cursor back to it's previous location. This is particularly useful when you need to move down in a long file to copy a variable or function name and then go back to your original position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                            |
| 07 | Share your localhost                          | This tip is brought to you by Jonathan Carter. VS Code Live Share enables you to share any TCP process on your computer with people who are currently connected to your Live Share session. Choose "Share Server" from the Command Palette and select a port to share. Now they can access your localhost like it's their localhost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                            |
| 08 | JavaScript Scratch Pad                        | Use the Quokka.js extension to create a JavaScript scratchpad that executes JavaScript/TypeScript as you type it with output in the terminal and inline with VS Code. Note that this is based on a paid service, but there is a free plan that works by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | M - x eshll , $ node . (And it's bad on free services !)                                                                                   |
| 09 | Version Lense                                 | This tip is brought to you by Elijah Manor. Easily see what npm packages are out of date with the Version Lense plugin. Toggle errors and warnings on and off as well as updating to the latest available version of a package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                            |
| 10 | Search User Settings                          | There are over 400 settings in VS Code, and that doesn't include settings for extensions. VS Code uses a search AI that helps you find what you need, even if you aren't sure exactly what you're looking for. Just search settings the way that you would search the internet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | M-x customize                                                                                                                              |
| 11 | Refactor To ES6                               | VS Code can refactor your JavaScript to ES6. It can update imports, convert prototype functions to ES6 classes and more. Anytime you see an ellipsis, you may be able to refactor that code. Check the lightbulb to find out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | JS2-refactor: https://github.com/magnars/js2-refactor.el                                                                                   |
| 12 | Serverless                                    | The Azure Functions extension for VS Code enables a full Serverless development experience in the editor. Create new projects and triggers locally, debug, manage Functions projects in Azure and setup deployments wthout ever leaving VS Code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                            |
| 13 | Move Side Bar Right                           | The code we write left-aligned by default. When the sidebar is on the left, expanding and collapsing it causes the jarring effect of moving the code in the viewport. Keeping the Side Bar on the right ensures that the viewport always stays the same. The Side Bar in VS Code can be collapsed with ⌘/⌃ + B. It can be moved to the right-hand side by selecting 'View / Move Side Bar Right".                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                            |
| 14 | Toggle Activity Bar                           | You might know that the Sidebar can be toggled with Cmd/Ctrl B. The ActivityBar can also be toggled to make even more room. The Multi-Key Extension allows for multiple commands to be bound to a single keystroke. This keystroke can then hide both the sidebar and the activity bar at the same time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                            |

| 19 | Deployment                                    | VS Code can deploy applications directly to Azure with the Azure App Service Tools extension. The extension creates the site via a wizard and then generates a shell script which automates the CLI commands to check code into Git and then pull into Azure. When using AppService for Linux,npm install and npm start are run automatically by Azure.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 🤔                                                                                                                                           |
| 20 | Settings Sync                                 | Use the Settings Sync extension to synchronize your theme, user preferences and installed plugins across installations of VS Code. Note that these instances do not have to be on the same machine. In fact, you can share your exact setup of VS Code with a friend or collegue simply by publishing your settings publically and sending them the ID. Note that this is particularly useful for keeping VS Code stable and the Insiders Build in sync.                                                                                                              | All your setting are set in `~/.emacs.d/init.el` .
